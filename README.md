Repository for hardware extio dlls.

Extio_Skeleton   - Bare bones source that can be used as the basis for a new
                   extio dll project.

Extio_Si5351     - Visual Studio project for extio dll used with the Si5351
                   signal generator described [here](https://ceworkbench.wordpress.com/2016/02/12/a-simple-si5351-signal-generator.

Extio_Si5351x4   - Same as Extio_Si5351 but sets the frequency 4x the 
                   displayed frequency.  For use with SDRs that use a 
		   quadrature generator based on the D-type flip flops.
